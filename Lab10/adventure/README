To implement the Adventure contract, you should do the following steps:

(1) make
  Compile all the source files, including the main function (adventure_main.c).

(2) ./adventure_main [PathName] [PoolSize]
  The main function is in adventure_main.c. After compiling, you would be able to run it. 
   
  To run the main function, you need to identify two arguments:
  1st: the pathname indicating which path to run. 
	 A valid argument is one of level, power, subtlety, strategy, charm
  2nd: an integer number indicating the size of the thread pool.
	 A valid argument is an integer greater than zero.

  Any invalid arguments would cause the program to exit.


[Note]

Each time when inputting "./adventure_main [PathName] [PoolSize]", the program runs only once with
the two arguments. Therefore, if you want to run different paths, you have to do Step (2) again with 
another two valid arguments.

After running the program, corresponding output files will be produced. You can find them in the
same directory. File names are PathName_alive and PathName_dead, where PathName is one of (level, 
power, subtlety, strategy, charm).

Because the program generates output files using the pathname as a part of the file names, if you 
run the program many times with the same path name, all output files will be overwritten. Only files 
generated during the last time will remain.....Of course, that does not matter as each time the program 
produces pretty much the same files with the same pathname.
