To implement Deus ex contract, you should do the following steps:

(1) make
  Compile all the source files, including the main function (deusex_main.c).

(2) ./deusex_main [PoolSize]
  The main function is stored in deusex_main.c. After compiling, you would be able to run it. 
   
  To run the main function, you need to identify one argument:
  an integer number indicating the size of the thread pool.

  Any other types will cause the program to exit.


[Note]

After running the program, output files will be generated. You can find them in the same directory. 
File names are deusex_alive and deusex_dead.

Deus ex contract uses the following idea to allow heroes to reach their highest potential level:

In the main function, all paths associated with locations' ratings will be generated, they are: 
Power Path, Subtlety Path, Strategy Path, Charm Path.
 
Assign the optimal path to each hero, using their primary attribute. The primary attribute is the 
greatest among all four attributes. A path would be easier for the hero to challenge if they use 
the primary attribute, as paths are locations in order by corresponding rating smallest to greatest.
For example, if a hero's primary attribute is strength, then Power Path is optimal.

To do so, I modified the function that creates Args for the thread pool. When creating the queue of
Args, check which attribute is primary for each hero, then assign the corresponding optimal path.
After that, put the Args queue to the thread pool to execute.
